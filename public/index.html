				<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>
				  As a boy, I enjoyed working with my hands, creating things, and learning how things work.  I would work on the lawn mower and other machines around the house to understand how they worked.  I started my college career in Communications and enjoyed learning about how people communicate effectively.  Again, here was something to do with creation.  I thought I could help create good communication among people and help avoid conflict.   As I joined the workforce, however, I ended up in a career that was not my passion.  I did all the things I thought I should be doing as an adult but something was missing.  I was going through the motions and was not excited about facing each day.  I tried different things hoping to find that passion or fire again, but nothing seemed to fit.
				  <br>
				  <br>  
				  One evening I was talking to a relative who does Web Development and listening to him describe what he does sparked my interest.  That night I went online and started doing some research of my own, I completed a few lessons on Code Academy and fell in love with coding.  I felt as though I had found what was missing in my career.  The fire was back and here I was creating something again with my hands.  I  quickly enrolled in RockIT bootcamp and enjoyed every moment of it.  I was taught web/software development in the languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, SASS, PHP, Backbone, and many others.  I completed projects in these languages and continue to be excited about it every day. Since graduating from RockIT I have been practicing the skills I learned as well as learning more about other languages.  I wake each morning eager to create something new.  I love trying to figure out solutions to broken code.  I get excited each time I see something I have programed work.  I enjoy every minute of it and look forward to an exciting and fulfilling career in Web Development. I am a husband and father of four.  I am a family man who loves superheroes, movies and the outdoors. I love code and the thrill of seeing it come to life.  I am a creator. I am a problem-solver.  I am a Web Developer.
